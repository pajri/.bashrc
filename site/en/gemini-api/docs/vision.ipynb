Here's how such a product might be manufactured:\n\n1. **Material Selection:**  Most likely a thermoplastic like polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) would be used due to their flexibility, durability, and food-safe properties.  The specific type would depend on the desired clarity, temperature resistance, and cost.\n\n2. **Mold Creation:** A two-part steel mold would be created. This mold would be a precise negative of the desired container shape, including the lid.\n\n3. **Injection Molding:**  This is the most common process.  Pellets of the chosen plastic are melted and injected under high pressure into the closed mold.  The plastic fills the mold cavity and cools, solidifying into the container shape.\n\n4. **Mold Opening and Ejection:**  The mold opens, and ejector pins push the newly formed container out.\n\n5. **Lid Production (if separate):**  The lid would be manufactured in a similar process using a separate mold.\n\n6. **Trimming and Finishing:**  Excess plastic, called \"flash,\" might need to be trimmed from the edges of the container and lid.\n\n7. **Quality Control:**  Containers are inspected for defects, dimensional accuracy, and overall quality.\n\n8. **Packaging and Distribution:** The finished containers are then packaged and shipped to retailers or directly to consumers.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* **Thermoforming:**  For thinner, more flexible containers, thermoforming might be used.  In this process, a sheet of plastic is heated and then formed over a mold using vacuum or pressure.\n* **Extrusion Blow Molding:** This could be used for creating hollow containers like bottles, but less likely for a simple food storage container.  A tube of molten plastic is extruded and then inflated within a mold to create the final shape.\n\nThe drawing's simplicity suggests a basic, injection-molded container is the most probable manufacturing method.\n"
